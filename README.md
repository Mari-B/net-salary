# Annual Net Salary Calculator
I've created this webpage to easily calculate your:
- annual net salary
- annual tax due
- annual NI due

## Installation
There is no need to install any packages because I've included the only external library that I've used (Cleave) in the project folder.

## Usage
The calculator is accessible via any web browser at this link: https://mari-b.github.io/net-salary/index.html
To run it locally on your machine, you simply need to:
- clone this repository on your machine
- run index.html on your browser, preferably with a Live Server
- type your gross annual salary in the input windown, as indicated on the scree
- click on "Calculate"
- the final amounts will appear in the table below
