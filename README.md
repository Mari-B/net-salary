# Annual Net Salary Calculator
I've created this webpage to easily calculate your:
- annual net salary
- annual tax due
- annual NI due

## Installation
There is no need to install any packages because I've included the only external library that I've used (Cleave) in the project folder.

## Usage

The calculator is accessible via a web browser at this link: https://mari-b.github.io/net-salary/index.html

To run it locally on your machine, you simply need to:
- clone this repository on your machine
- run index.html on your browser (I have used Live Server on VSCode)
- type your gross annual salary in the input window, as indicated on the screen
- click on "Calculate"
- the final amounts will appear in the table below
